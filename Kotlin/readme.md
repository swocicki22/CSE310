# Overview

I have always been fascinated by coding, and what really goes into making a program run. That I think, is what interests me so much, how much information can go into building something so simple.

This software, as simple as it was, was by far the most difficult I have ever done. Kotlin will forver go down as my least favorite coding language, and also my most respected. Due to the fact that it gave
me so many hiccups, at one point I was ready to be done with it. 

That's enough rambling, the software is a dice roller pointed towards rolling a total of 21, and it gives the user 4 attempts to roll.

# Development Environment

I was big on tutorials, getting C# to open in VScode without any errors included deleting the folder probably 10+ times, and downloading dotnet I tihnk 5 times, it was a struggle and thanks to youtube, I was able to get it to work.

# Future Work/Improvements

- I don't think i was ever able to reach 21 after around 50 attempts so maybe some changes to make the game easier to win. 
- I would like to make the game not so "botty" it seemed lifeless with the dialogue.
