# Overview

I have always been fascinated by coding, and what really goes into making a program run. That I think, is what interests me so much, how much information can go into building something so simple.

This software, was by far the most fun I have had so far, it is amazing to me to look at my code from 2-3 years ago to now and just see how much of my personality I can put into it. That is something
that is so cool to see

That's enough rambling, the software is a "guess the prophet" game about selecting the correct prophet and some various facts about them.
