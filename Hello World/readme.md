# Overview

With this little project it was fun to get back to the roots of Python Programming, the very first "progran" that I wrote was one that involved Hello World, so it was nice to just repeat that and see how far I truly have come. 

It's just a simple user input program that involves 3 outcomes, with "Y" being the preferred input to see the output of Hello World, "N" just tells the user goodbye and any other input just lets the user know they have not entered the desired input,
I was going to include a loop that would go back to the beginning but I didn't see it neccesary for such a simple program. 

The reasoning behind this software is just to keep learning and suring up that foundation.

# Development Environment

I used VScode and my knowledge of Python to write a simple program, I threw some sarcasm in there just for the fun of it.
