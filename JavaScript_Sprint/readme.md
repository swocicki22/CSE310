# Overview

I have always struggled with creating to do lists and following through with them, to me it just seems at times to just go with the flow and take what is given to you. However, as I have continued in my career, to do lists have provided me with a great guide to staying focused on what really is important when it comes to the tasks at hand. For that reason, I decided to create something that I have struggled to use as a way of pushing me to stay on track. 

I customized the software to include, my current classes for BYU-Idaho, as well as a seperate to do list that can include anything outside of school. Once a "to do" item has been completed, you have the option to remove it.

# Development Environment

Just like my C++ sprint, guides were helpful, but, at the same time I am extremely comfortable coding in javascript for that reason I decided to implement some HTML into the peoject to make it readable through a web application.

# Future Work/Improvements

- Id like to obviously add some graphics, or maybe some colors into the future, but for now I feel it serves its purpose. 
- I'd like to expand the to-do list to have more options than just classes for the BYU-Idaho portion, because obviously there is more than just classes while in college, this could include social events or sports. 
- As always make it more complex!
