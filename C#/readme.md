# Overview

I have always been fascinated by coding, and what really goes into making a program run. That I think, is what interests me so much, how much information can go into building something so simple.

This software, as simple as it was, was by far the most difficult I have ever done. C# will forver go down as my least favorite coding language, and also my most respected. Due to the fact that it gave
me so many hiccups, at one point I was ready to be done with it. 

That's enough rambling, the software is a name guesser for book of mormon characters, and it gives the user 6 attempts to guess letters that may or may not be in the name.

# Development Environment

I was big on tutorials, getting C# to open in VScode without any errors included deleting the folder probably 10+ times, and downloading dotnet I tihnk 5 times, it was a struggle and thanks to youtube, I was able to get it to work.

# Future Work/Improvements

- I need to fix the first letter being case-sensitive, that was something that bogged me down in the beginning.
- Adding a timer would be cool, but I do not like C# so I probably will not be adding that.
