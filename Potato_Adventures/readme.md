# Overview

I have always been fascinated by coding, and what really goes into making a program run. That I think, is what interests me so much, how much information can go into building something so simple.

This software, was by far the most fun I have had so far, it is amazing to me to look at my code from 2-3 years ago to now and just see how much of my personality I can put into it. That is something
that is so cool to see

That's enough rambling, the software is a "choose your own adventure" game about a potato farmer in Idaho who may or may not come in contact with characters from other universes. His whole goal is to make
it through one day, if he does that he has won the game.

[Potato Adventure]()

# Development Environment

Because this was in Python, this was all about pushing myself and creating a fun game that can be connected to BYU-Idaho as well as my favorite movie(s).

# Future Work/Improvements

- I'd like to add more days to this to make it more of a game that is more involved, however for now, I think it is just fine.  
- I'd like to add more characters to the game as well.
