# Overview

I have always been fascinated by coding, and what really goes into making a program run. That I think, is what interests me so much, how much information can go into building something so simple.

This software that I designed is a simple number guessing game that probes the user to start guessing a random number from 1-100, if they get the answer wrong the program will tell them that its too high or too low. Once they get the answer
right they will be given the option to continue to the next level, which is then a game from 1-110. And so the game goes on in a cool little loop-style game.

My goal was to push myself, I haven't really coded much in C++ and as a result it was some what complicated and frustrating trying to get the program to run in vscode while working through getting the compiler to work. At the end
of the day I achieved my goal, the program runs smoothly, and I am quite proud of it.

# Development Environment

I was big on tutorials, c++ syntax is relatively simple, but it is different from Python so looking up syntax guides and learning what to look for was very helpful. 

This project was done strictly in C++

# Future Work/Improvements

- More Personalized, maybe add some different layers to ask them which type of game they'd like to play.
- Make the game feel more life-like with better responses, that are not so 01010 type responses. 
- Make it more complex. Number guessers are cool, but I imagine I could go much deeper as far as complexity.
